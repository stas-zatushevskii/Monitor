1 generate private key ----->  RSA-OAEP
2 gets from private key public key

server
1 gets private key
2 receive data from agent
3 gets generated by agent NONCE
4 decrypt data by private key
5 remove NONCE from decrypted data
DONE

agent
1 gets public key
2 generate symmetric key  ---->  AES-256
3 encrypt symmetric key AES-256 by public key   ---->  AES-GCM
4 generate NONCE (random slice of byte. It is needed so that the same messages encoded with the same key have different outputs.)
5 encrypt data using hybrid method:
  - add in raw message NONCE
  - encrypt raw message by symmetric key
6 send data to the server {
    encrypted data
    NONCE
    encrypted symmetric key (can be decrypted only by Secret key)
}
DONE
